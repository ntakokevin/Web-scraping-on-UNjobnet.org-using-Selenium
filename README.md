In this work we will use the selenuim library of python to extract Data science, Date engineer, Data analyst, Statistician, Research offer job anouncement on www.UNjobnet.org

Data Gathering
As you know in Data Science projects, you don't always do machine learning and/or sophisticated statistical analysis. In most cases, you build systems to collect data, process data and then finally do the analysis. This is a data gathering project which we will call the jobs-scraper.

Motivation and project goal
As an upcoming data scientist who just graduated, you are obviously busy looking for data science vacancies to apply to. In this quest, you are targeting jobs in international organizations such as UNICEF, UNDP, the World Bank Group and others. To this end, you have noted that some websites aggregate vacancies for most prominent UN organizations. Some of these websites are listed below: 
UNjobnet
UN-job-list
UN-careers
UNjobs

In this mini-project, the goal is to develop a Python script which can automatically download data science job vacancies from the websites above, save a list of those jobs on your computer and email them to yourself and your colleagues. This is so that you can keep track of these job postings on a daily basis and apply to some of them. 

In the rest of this document, more details about this project as below are provided: 

Expected outputs from the script
Guidelines in solving this problem 
Quality of data science project setup

Expected outputs from the script  
Once the system (or script) is completed, we expect that it should have the functionalities and produce  outputs listed below.
Extract and download vacancy details for jobs with titles such as Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Data Analyst, Statistician, Research Officer.
For each job advert, the following details are required: 
the position title
duty station (city and country where position is based)
position status (full-time, consultant etc)
date posted (when his vacancy was posted)
due date for application
url for the full job description
the organization hiring (name)
The information above should be saved in a CSV file
The CSV file above should be sent to an email list
